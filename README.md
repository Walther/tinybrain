# tinybrain.js
Tiny brain is a naive, minimalistic, neural network implementation from scratch.

Provided example usecase is a simple bot for playing the board game Go.

Motivation:

- polishing up my data structures and algorithms skills
- learning more about the implementation side of neural networks
- completing the course "tiralabra" (data structures and algorithms: project)
